    "Previously, we learned about ARIMA Models which builds a formula for future values as a function of past data – assuming causality between past and future. Today, we’ll explore Facebook’s Prophet tool, which makes use of an “Additive Model”. Instead of attempting to forecast based on a function of past data, additive models look at major “change points” in trends through combining (hence additive) factors, i.e. looking for the “best fit curve” for our data.\n",

    "- $s(t)$ is our general data trend, which attempts to capture the general direction of our time-series through fitting piecewise linear or lin-log functions at “change points”. \n",
    "- $g(t)$ is our seasonal component using Fourier series for larger periods (months, years), and dummy variables for small periods (weeks) \n",
    "- $h(t)$ are our important holidays / exception points provided by the user or the default list. These are modeled as gaussian functions for smoothing.\n",

    "Some food for thought: in 2021 Zillow’s data science team allegedly made heavy use of Prophet as the basis of their price prediction model, which failed to predict houses accurately enough leading to a loss of $300MM in a single quarter. [Read more](https://ryxcommar.com/2021/11/06/zillow-prophet-time-series-and-prices/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important considerations to keep in mind when using Prophet is that it assumes:  \n",
    "- Additivity, it is assumed that our trend, seasonality, holidays and error are independent and can be combined linearly. Additionally, Prophet does not assume a stochastic trend. \n",
    "- Seasonality, it is assumed that seasonal patterns repeat over time cyclically (yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, etc) and predictably.\n",
    "- Holidays & exceptions, Prophet makes use of built in lists of holiday effects it is assumed that these effects are constant over time [read more](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/seasonality,_holiday_effects,_and_regressors.html)\n",
    "- Errors are assumed to be due to noise (and hence Gaussian). This gives up some inferential advantages of ARIMA (in return for more relaxed and plausible assumptions), as we do not assume causal relations between our past data/errors and our future ones (no autocorrelation on residual). \n"
