    "#### Historical Background\n",
    "Amidst an economic downturn in Cuba, an increasing number of dissident Cubans were looking to leave the country and seek asylum. In response, on April 20, 1980, Cuban President Fidel Castro announced that any Cuban who wished to leave the island could do so, reversing the communist regimeâ€™s closed emigration policy. Between April and October 1980, some 1,700 boats, many arranged by Cuban exiles already in the United States, carried Cubans from the port of Mariel (the departure zone designated by the Cuban government) to Florida. \n",
    "\n",
    "In response, President Jimmy Carter declared temporarily a state of emergency in affected areas. On June 20, he established the Cuban-Haitian Entrant Program (CHEP), granting temporary status, access to asylum processing and community assistance for both Cubans and Haitians fleeing to the United States. Hundreds of Cubans arrived in Florida daily. The CHEP coverage window ended after the Carter administration negotiated an end to the boatlifts with the Cuban government in October 1980. ([Source](https://immigrationhistory.org/item/mariel-boatlift/))\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Economic Impact\n",
    "About half of the Mariel immigrants decided to live in Miami permanently, which resulted in \"a 7\\% increase in the labor force of Miami and a 20\\% increase in the number of Cuban workers in Miami\" ([Card (1990)](https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf)). Aside from the unemployment rate rising from 5.0\\% in April 1980 to 7.1\\% in July, the actual damage to the economy was marginal and followed trends across the United States at the time. When observing data from 1979 to 1985 on the Miami labor market and comparing it with similar data from several other major cities across the United States, focusing on wages, the effects of the boatlift were marginal ([Alejandro and Leif (1989)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2095716)). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Approach\n",
    "Since immigrants have the freedom to choose their destinations (and will naturally choose those places with strong labor markets), it is normally not enough to simply look at places with more immigrants to determine causal effects on the local labor market. However, Card argued that with the Mariel Boatlift, the arrival of immigrants had very little to do with the local labor market of that place. Here is his argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The experiences of the Miami labor market in the aftermath of the Mariel Boatlift form one such \\[\"natural\"\\] experiment. From May to September 1980, some 125,000 Cuban immigrants arrived in Miami on a flotilla of privately chartered boats. Their arrival was the consequence of an unlikely sequence of events culminating in Castro's declaration on April 20, 1980, that Cubans wishing to emigrate to the United States were free to leave from the port of Mariel. Fifty percent of the Mariel immigrants settled permanently in Miami. The result was a 7% increase in the labor force of Miami and a 20% increase in the number of Cuban workers in Miami. (Card, 1990:245-6)\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor David Card received the Nobel Prize in Economics \"for his empirical contributions to labour economics\", including this paper among others. He delivered his [prize-winning lecture](https://youtu.be/wD48p6m8U-8?t=237) (talking about this topic, among others) on 8 December 2021.\n",
    "\n",

When `HS` is 1, it means the individual in this row has a high school degree (but not a Bachelor's degree). When both `BA` and `HS` are 0, that implies `lessHS` should be 1, and it means the individual in this row has less education than a high school degree. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore when `BA` and `HS` show up in a regression, we can interpret their coefficients as the following:\n",
    "- Coefficient for `BA`: the average amount of wages an individual with a Bachelor's degree earns *minus* the average amount of wages an individual with less than a high school degree earns. In other words, if the coefficient is 1, then we can say that on average an individual with a Bachelor's degree earns 1 unit (what's the unit?) more than an individual with less than a high school degree. \n",
    "- Coefficient for `HS`: the average amount of wages an individual with a high school degree earns *minus* the average amount of wages an individual with less than a high school degree earns. \n",

    "In this project, we saw that the Mariel boatlift had little effect on unemployment among ethnic groups in Miami, as the cities that were not receiving \\(many\\) immigrants were afflicted by the same trends in unemployment. We also saw that the same is true of education-level groups. In fact, many studies find that influxes of immigrants benefit the native-born workers in a region; that they act as complements rather than supplements to the native workforce."
